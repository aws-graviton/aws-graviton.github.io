| Congratulations! You have successfully installed the netCDF |
| Fortran libraries.                                          |
|                                                             |
| You can use script "nf-config" to find out the relevant     |
| compiler options to build your application. Enter           |
|                                                             |
|     nf-config --help                                        |
|                                                             |
| for additional information.                                 |
|                                                             |
| CAUTION:                                                    |
|                                                             |
| If you have not already run "make check", then we strongly  |
| recommend you do so. It does not take very long.            |
|                                                             |
| Before using netCDF to store important data, test your      |
| build with "make check".                                    |
|                                                             |
| NetCDF is tested nightly on many platforms at Unidata       |
| but your platform is probably different in some ways.       |
|                                                             |
| If any tests fail, please see the netCDF web site:          |

|                                                             |
| NetCDF is developed and maintained at the Unidata Program   |
| Center. Unidata provides a broad array of data and software |
| tools for use in geoscience education and research.         |

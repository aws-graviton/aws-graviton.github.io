<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This document is a reference for software developers who want to optimize code
for Graviton Arm64 processors at the assembly level. Some of the documented
transforms could be applied to optimize code written in higher level languages
like C or C++, and in that respect this document is not restrictive to assembly
level programming. This guide isn’t intended cover every aspect of writing in
assembly, such as assembler syntax or ABI details.</p>
<p>The code patterns in this document could also be useful to spot inefficient code
generated for the hot code. Profilers such as Linux perf allow the inspection of
the assembly level code. During the review of the hot code, software developers
can reference this guide to find better ways to optimize inner loops.</p>
<p>To develop code for AWS Gravition, we always recommend developing and testing on
Graviton itself to ensure that the optimizations you make are targeted toward
Graviton. The microarchitecture of other Arm64 cores may be different in ways
that lead to different optimizations.</p>

<h2 id="instruction-level-parallelism"><a class="header" href="#instruction-level-parallelism">Instruction Level Parallelism</a></h2>
<p>When writing in C, or any higher level language, the programmer writes a sequence
of statements which are presumed to execute in strict sequence. In the following
example, each statement logically occurs after the previous one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int foo (int a, int b, int c)
{
    if (c &lt; 0) {
        int d = a + b;
        return d;
    } else {
        int e = a * b;
        return e;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>However when we compile this code with gcc version 7.3 with <code>-O1</code>, this is the output:</p>
<pre><code>foo(int, int, int):
    add     w3, w0, w1
    mul     w0, w0, w1
    cmp     w2, 0
    csel    w0, w0, w3, ge
    ret
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see the add and the multiply instruction are executed independently
of the result of <code>c &lt; 0</code>. The compiler knows that the CPU can execute these
instructions in parallel. If we use the machine code analyzer from the LLVM
project, we can can see what is happening. We will use Graviton2 as our target
platform, which uses the Neoverse-N1 core.</p>
<p><code>llvm-mca -mcpu=neoverse-n1 -timeline -iterations 1 foo.s</code></p>
<pre><code>...
Timeline view:
Index     012345

[0,0]     DeER .   add  w3, w0, w1
[0,1]     DeeER.   mul  w0, w0, w1
[0,2]     DeE-R.   cmp  w2, #0
[0,3]     D==eER   csel w0, w0, w3, ge
[0,4]     DeE--R   ret
...
</code></pre>
<p>In this output we can see that all five instructions from this function are decoded
in parallel in the first cycle. Then in the second cycle the instructions for which
all dependencies are already resolved begin executing. There is only one instruction
which has dependencies: the conditional select, <code>csel</code>. The four remaining
instructions all begin executing, including the <code>ret</code> instruction at the end. In
effect, nearly the entire C function is executing in parallel. The
<code>csel</code> has to wait for the result of the comparison instruction to check
<code>c &lt; 0</code> and the result of the multiplication. Even the return has
completed by this point and the CPU front end has already decoded
instructions in the return path and some of them will already be
executing as well.</p>
<p>It is important to understand this when writing assembly. Instructions
do not execute in the order they appear. Their effects will be logically
sequential, but execution order will not be.</p>
<p>When writing assembly for arm64 or any platform, be aware that the CPU has more
than one pipeline of different types. The types and quantities are outlined in
the Software Optimization Guide, often abbreviated as SWOG. The guide
for each Graviton processor is linked from the <a href="README.html">main page of this
technical guide</a>. Using this knowledge, the programmer can arrange instructions of
different types next to each other to take advantage of instruction level
parallelism, ILP. For example, interleaving load instructions with vector or
floating point instructions can keep both pipelines busy.</p>
<h2 id="split-data-dependency-chains"><a class="header" href="#split-data-dependency-chains">Split Data Dependency Chains</a></h2>
<p>As we saw in the last section, Graviton has multiple pipelines or execution units which can execute instructions. The instructions may execute in parallel if all of the input dependencies have been met but a series of instructions each of which depend on a result from the previous one will not be able to efficiently utilize the resources of the CPU.</p>
<p>For example, a simple C function which takes 64 signed 8-bit integers and adds them all up into one value could be implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code>int16_t add_64(int8_t *d) {
    int16_t sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 64; i++) {
        sum += d[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We could write this in assembly using NEON SIMD instructions like this:</p>
<pre><code>add_64_neon_01:
    ld1     {v0.16b, v1.16b, v2.16b, v3.16b} [x0]   // load all 64 bytes into vector registers v0-v3
    movi    v4.2d, #0                               // zero v4 for use as an accumulator
    saddw   v4.8h, v4.8h, v0.8b                     // add bytes 0-7 of v0 to the accumulator
    saddw2  v4.8h, v4.8h, v0.16b                    // add bytes 8-15 of v0 to the accumulator
    saddw   v4.8h, v4.8h, v1.8b                     // ...
    saddw2  v4.8h, v4.8h, v1.16b
    saddw   v4.8h, v4.8h, v2.8b
    saddw2  v4.8h, v4.8h, v2.16b
    saddw   v4.8h, v4.8h, v3.8b
    saddw2  v4.8h, v4.8h, v3.16b
    addv    h0, v4.8h                               // horizontal add all values in the accumulator to h0
    fmov    w0, h0                                  // copy vector registor h0 to general purpose register w0
    ret                                             // return with the result in w0
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we use a signed add-wide instruction which adds the top and bottom of each register to v4 which is used to accumulate the sum. This is the worst case for data dependency chains because every instruction depends on the result of the previous one which will make it impossible for the CPU to achieve any instruction level parallelism. If we use <code>llvm-mca</code> to evaluate it we can see this clearly.</p>

<p>One way to break data dependency chains is to use commutative property of addition and change the order which the adds are completed. Consider the following alternative implementation which makes use of pairwise add instructions.</p>
<pre><code>add_64_neon_02:
    ld1     {v0.16b, v1.16b, v2.16b, v3.16b} [x0]

    saddlp  v0.8h, v0.16b                   // signed add pairwise long

<p>In this example the first 4 instructions after the load can execute independently and then the next 2 are also independent of each other.  However, the last 3 instructions do have data dependencies on each other. If we take a look with <code>llvm-mca</code> again, we can see that this implementation takes 17 cycles (excluding the initial load instruction common to both implementations) and the original takes 27 cycles.</p>

<h2 id="modulo-scheduling"><a class="header" href="#modulo-scheduling">Modulo Scheduling</a></h2>
<p>When writing a loop in assembly that contains several dependent steps in each
iteration but there are no dependencies between iterations (or only superficial
dependencies), modulo scheduling can improve performance. Modulo scheduling is
the processes of combining loop unrolling with the interleaving of steps from
other iterations of the loop. For example, suppose we have a loop which has four
steps, A, B, C, and D. We can unroll that loop to execute 4 iterations in
parallel with vector instructions such that we complete steps like this: A₀₋₃,
B₀₋₃, C₀₋₃, D₀₋₃. However this construction still has a dependency chain which
the last section taught us to avoid. We can break that chain by scheduling the
steps with modulo scheduling.</p>
<pre><code>A1
B1 A2
C1 B2 A3
D1 C2 B3 A4
   D2 C3 B4
      D3 C4

<p>Take the following example written in C. I noted step A through step D in the
source, but the lines in C don’t map cleanly onto the steps I selected for
implementation in assembly.</p>

    {
        // step A: load src_position[i] and multiplier[i]
        int src_pos = src_positions[i];
        // step B: load src[src_pos] and copy the value to a vector register
        // step C: sign extend int8_t to int16_t, multiply, and saturate-shift right
        int32_t val = multiplier[i] * src[src_pos];
        destination[i] = min(val &gt;&gt; 3, (1 &lt;&lt; 15) - 1);

<p>The assembly implementation is faster, which is great, but lets see how we can
do better. We could take this a step further and employ modulo scheduling. This
increases the complexity of the implementation, but for hot functions which
execute many iterations, this may be worth it. In order to make this work,
we have to prime the loop with a prologue section:</p>
<pre><code>A1
B1 A2
C1 B2 A3
</code></pre>
<p>Then we run a steady state loop:</p>
<pre><code>D1 C2 B3 A4
</code></pre>
<p>And finally an epilogue to complete the iterations:</p>
<pre><code>   D2 C3 B4
      D3 C4
         D4
</code></pre>
<p>In order to make this work, each step must consume all of the outputs of the
previous step and not use as temporary registers any of the inputs or outputs of
other steps. For this example, step A loads the value of <code>multiplier[i]</code> but it
is not consumed until step C, so in step B we simply copy its value with a <code>mov</code>
instruction. This implementation could look like this:</p>

<p>If we benchmark these functions on Graviton3, this is the result:</p>
<pre><code>modulo_scheduling_example_c_01 - runtime: 1.598776 s
modulo_scheduling_example_asm_01 - runtime: 1.492209 s
modulo_scheduling_example_asm_02 - runtime: 1.583097 s
</code></pre>
<p>It’s still faster than the C implementation, but it’s slower than our first
pass. Let’s add another trick. If we check the software optimization guide for
Graviton2, the Neoverse N1, we see that the <code>ins</code> instruction has a whopping
5-cycle latency with only 1 instruction per cycle of total throughput. There are
8 <code>ins</code> instructions which will take at least 13 cycles to complete, the whole
time tying up vector pipeline resources.</p>
<p>If we instead outsource that work to the load and store pipelines, we can leave
the vector pipelines to process the math instructions in step C. To do this,
after each byte is loaded, we write them back to memory on the stack with <code>strb</code>
instructions to lay down the bytes in the order that we need them to be in the
vector register. Then in the next step we use a ld1 instruction to put those
bytes into a vector register. This approach probably has more latency (but I
haven’t calculated it), but since the next step which consumes the outputs is
three steps away, it leaves time for those instructions to complete before we
need those results. For this technique, we revise only the macros for steps B
and C:</p>
<pre><code>.macro modulo_scheduling_example_asm_03_step_B
    mov v4.16b, v5.16b

    strb w13, [sp, #16]
    strb w14, [sp, #17]
    strb w15, [sp, #18]
    strb w16, [sp, #19]

    strb w17, [sp, #20]
    strb w18, [sp, #21]
    strb w19, [sp, #22]
    strb w20, [sp, #23]
.endm

.macro modulo_scheduling_example_asm_03_step_C
    mov v1.16b, v4.16b
    ldr d0, [sp, #16]
.endm
</code></pre>
<p>This technique gets the best of both implementations and running the benchmark
again produces these results:</p>
<pre><code>modulo_scheduling_example_c_01 - runtime: 1.598776 s
modulo_scheduling_example_asm_01 - runtime: 1.492209 s
modulo_scheduling_example_asm_02 - runtime: 1.583097 s
modulo_scheduling_example_asm_03 - runtime: 1.222440 s
</code></pre>
<p>Nice. Now we have the fastest implementation yet with a 24% speed improvement.
But wait! What if the improvement is only from the trick where we save the
intermediate values on the stack in order to get them into the right order and
modulo scheduling isn’t helping. Let’s benchmark the case where we use this
trick without modulo scheduling.</p>
<pre><code>modulo_scheduling_example_asm_04 - runtime: 2.106044 s
</code></pre>
<p>Ooof. That’s the slowest implementation yet. The reason this trick works is
because it divides work up between vector and memory pipelines and stretches out
the time until the results are required to continue the loop. Only when we do
both of these things, do we achieve this performance.</p>
<p>I didn’t mention SVE gather load instructions on purpose. They would most
definitely help here, and we will explore that in the future.</p>
<h1 id="test-everything"><a class="header" href="#test-everything">Test Everything</a></h1>
<p>Test everything and make no assumptions. When you are writing hand optimized
assembly or intrinsics to achieve the best performance, speed can be impacted in
surprising and unintuitive ways even for experienced assembly developers, so
it’s important to create micro benchmarks for every function that you work on.
It’s also important to consider how the function will be called. For example, a
kernel in a video encoder for computing the sum-absolute-difference of two
frames of video will be called repeatedly in a tight loop with similar or
identical arguments which will give the branch predictor and instruction caches
plenty of opportunity to train themselves to peak performance. Microbenchmarks
to test these types of functions in loops with fixed arguments are very useful
to measure performance. However, something like mempcy is called on irregular
intervals possibly with different arguments for each call. Benchmarking a
function like this in a tight loop may lead to misleading results since a tight
loop will over-train the branch predictor leading the same path being taken each
time, whereas in real workloads data dependent branches will incur a more
significant penalty. To properly benchmark memcpy we would need to benchmark it
with a distribution of length arguments similar to what you expect in a
production workload, which will vary widely.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits all approach for benchmarking, so as you design your
test harness, consider how the function will be used and design accordingly. You
may even want several types of microbenchmarks to evaluate changes to your
function across different conditions. Most functions written in assembly should
avoid the need for knowledge about an external structure so the author does not
have to make assumptions about the layout of memory which could be changed by
the compiler. This also makes it easier to extract these functions as small
kernels for testing separately from a large application in a standalone test
harness. A standalone test harness is very convenient, since it is likely to
build much more quickly than a large application the assembly function is a part
of, making iterative development quicker. In addition to testing a wide range of
input conditions, which is the case for any function in any language, assembly
functions should also be tested to ensure they do not violate the calling
convention. For example, some registers should not be modified, or if they are,
their contents should be spilled to the stack and reloaded before returning. For
some functions, especially if the input affects locations of memory
dereferencing, it is necessary to fuzz the function by generating random input
arguments, or all permutations, if it is feasible.</p>
<p>While testing is always important in software development, it is especially
important for assembly programming. Choose a test method that works for your case
and make thorough use of it.</p>
<h2 id="specialize-functions-for-known-input-conditions"><a class="header" href="#specialize-functions-for-known-input-conditions">Specialize functions for known input conditions</a></h2>
<p>Functions that are important enough to optimize with assembly often take very
predictable or specific code paths that are the same every time they are called.
For example, a hot function written in C may take an argument which specifies an
array length which the C will use in a loop termination condition. The C may be
written to accept any possible input for that length. However when we write the
function in assembly, it can be advantageous to make assumptions about the
arguments, such as “it will always be divisible by 2, 4, 8, or 16.” We can
handle these cases by checking if any of these assumptions is true at the top of
the function and then branch to a specialized portion of the function. Then the
specialized assembly can omit more general code to handle any possible input and
make use of loop unrolling or SIMD instructions which divide evenly into the
array length.</p>
<p>Another technique is to call hot functions through a function pointer. Before
setting the function pointer, if the input arguments can be verified to always
satisfy some conditions, like the length is divisible 16 and always non-zero, we
can set the pointer to an assembly function which is optimized based on those
assumptions. Authors of video codecs will be very familiar with this technique.
In fact,
<a href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libswscale/swscale.h">many</a>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git/src/master/source/common/aarch64/asm-primitives.cpp">encoders</a>
have a great deal of infrastructure just to dispatch work to specialized
functions which match the input conditions.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>int32_t sum_all(int8_t *values, int length)
{
   int32_t sum = 0;
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)
      sum += values[i];
   return sum;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If this is only ever called when length is divisible by 16 and non-zero, we can
implement in assembly like this:</p>
<pre><code>// x0 - int8_t *values
// w1 - int length
sum_all_x16_asm:
    movi v2.4s, #0           // zero out v2 for use as an accumulator
1:  ld1 {v0.16b}, [x0], #16  // load 16 bytes from values[i]
    saddlp v1.8h, v0.16b     // pairwise-add-long (A, B, C, D, ...) =&gt; (A+B, C+D, ...)
    sadalp v2.4s, v1.8h      // pairwise-add-accumulate-long (same, but add to v2)
    subs w1, w1, #16         // check the loop counter
    b.gt 1b                  // branch back if more iterations remain
    addv s0, v2.4s           // add-across the accumulator
    fmov w0, s0              // copy to general purpose register
    ret
</code></pre>
<p>In this implementation, we can skip the initial check to see if length is zero
and we can skip any checks for any unconsumed values if length was not divisible
by 16. A more complex function may be able to be unrolled farther or make more
assumptions about type conversions which are knowable based on the inputs, which
can improve execution speed even more.</p>
<h2 id="use-efficient-instructions"><a class="header" href="#use-efficient-instructions">Use Efficient Instructions</a></h2>
<p>Make yourself aware of the various types of instructions available to use.
Choosing the right instructions can make the difference between a 5 or 10
instructions sequence or just one instruction that does exactly what you need.
For example, saturating arithmetic instructions can replace a series of
instructions with just one. A rounding-shift-right-narrow can compute an average
of two integers with just two instructions instead of three with a truncating
right shift and in fewer cycles than the very expensive divide instruction.</p>
<p>One way this is especially true is the use of vector or instructions. We have
already mentioned Neon instructions in this document, but to make it clearer,
these instructions operation on multiple data lanes in parallel. They are also
known as SIMD or Single Instruction Multiple Data instructions. The full details
on how to use this type of programming is beyond the scope of this guide, but
when it’s possible to process 16 bytes in parallel instead of just one at a
time, the speed up can be significant.</p>
<p>Another way to use efficient instructions is to consult the <a href="README.html#building-for-graviton2-graviton3-and-graviton3e">software
optimization guide</a>.
Many different combinations of instructions can accomplish the same result, and
some are obviously better than others. Some instructions, like the
absolute-difference-accumulate-long instructions (<code>sabal</code> and <code>uabal</code>) can only
be executed on half of the vector pipelines in Neoverse V1, which slashes the
overall throughput of a series of independent instructions to two per cycle.
Using instead a series of absolute-difference instructions (<code>sabd</code> or <code>uabd</code>),
which can execute on all four pipelines, can increase the parallelism. If there
are enough of these instructions, this is worth the trade off of requiring a
separate step to add up the accumulating absolute difference. There are other
instructions which this applies to, so consult the software optimization guide
to see what the throughput and latency numbers are for the instructions you are
using.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Expand to see a code sample using the two different approaches for calculating
sum-absolute-difference.
</summary>
The first function in this example uses `uabal` which is limited to half of the
NEON execution units. The second uses more instructions to complete the final
sum, but since the instructions can execute on all NEON execution units, it runs
25% faster on Graviton3.
<p>This is a C implementation of the functions below for illustration.</p>
<pre><code>int sum_absolute_difference_c(uint8_t *a, uint8_t *b, int h)
{
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; h*64; i++) {
        s += abs(a[i] - b[i]);

<p>If the second approach is faster, why would we ever use <code>sabal</code> or <code>uabal</code>?
There is a trade off, of course. As you can see in the example, it takes more
instructions to avoid using <code>uabal</code> because you have to compute the accumulation
another way. It works well in this example because we can parallelize the SAD
computation across 64 bytes. If the amount of loop unrolling was more limited
(maybe because a result from the previous iteration is needed in the next), we
might not be able to parallelize enough SAD computations to keep 4 execution
units full. In that case it would probably make sense to use <code>uabal</code> since we
would already be unable to fill up the queues of 4 execution units.</p>
</details>
<p>Check to see what the compiler or several different compilers produce to see if
it can teach you any tricks. Sometimes just writing a short segment of code in C
in Compiler Explorer and seeing what the latest versions of GCC and Clang
produce with various levels of optimization can reveal tricks which you may not
have thought of. This doesn’t always produce useful results, especially since
writing in assembly suggests that the compiler’s output was not good enough, but
it can be a good way to explore ideas for implementing short segments of code.</p>
<p>Choosing the right instructions in an efficient way is something that takes
practice and familiarity with the instructions available in the ISA. It takes
time to get familiar with the broad array of options available to you as the
programmer and as an experienced engineer, you can produce some impressive
optimized code.</p>
